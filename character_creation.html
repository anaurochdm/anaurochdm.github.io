<title>The Fool's Postern - Character Creation</title>
<body>
<h1><b>Character Creation</b></h1>

<p>More info soon to come, but characters will start at <b>level 8</b>. All alignments are welcome in the Order. All content in the <i>5e Player's Handbook</i> and <i>Tasha's Cauldron of Everything</i> is welcome. If you want to use something from another book, let me know and I'm sure we can accommodate it; those are just the books that I'm most familiar with.</p>

<p>Note that I currently own and share both of those books with the Roll20 game, so you can access them (albeit not in the most readable form) via Roll20. The big advantage of owning the books on Roll20 is that their content is integrated with their character creation tool, known as the <a href="https://wiki.roll20.net/Charactermancer">Charactermancer</a>. I would strongly encourage everyone to use this -- not only does it make leveling up much simpler, it also integrates all of your character's abilities with the combat system basically out-of-the-box. This will make combat and other mechanical systems function a lot more smoothly.</p>

<p>As noted on the <a href="faction_info.html">faction info page</a> for the Order of the Timeless Peace, agents are organized into working units called pools. All of the player characters will belong to the same pool, although they may not always <i>all</i> be assigned to go on a particular mission together. This keeps things modular and lets the game continue even amidst variable player attendance.</p>
