<title>The Fool's Postern - Character Creation</title>
<body>
<h1><b>Character Creation</b></h1>

<p>More info soon to come, but characters will start at <b>level 8</b>. All alignments are welcome in the Order. All content in the <i>5e Player's Handbook</i> and <i>Tasha's Cauldron of Everything</i> is welcome. If you want to use something from another book, let me know and I'm sure we can accommodate it; those are just the books that I'm most familiar with.</p>

<p>Note that I currently own and share both of those books with the Roll20 game, so you can access them (albeit not in the most readable form) via Roll20. The big advantage of owning the books on Roll20 is that their content is integrated with their character creation tool, known as the <a href="https://wiki.roll20.net/Charactermancer">Charactermancer</a>. I would strongly encourage everyone to use this -- not only does it make leveling up much simpler, it also integrates all of your character's abilities with the combat system basically out-of-the-box. This will make combat and other mechanical systems function a lot more smoothly.</p>

<p>As noted on the <a href="faction_info.html">faction info page</a> for the Order of the Timeless Peace, agents are organized into working units called pools. All of the player characters will belong to the same pool, although they may not always <i>all</i> be assigned to go on a particular mission together. This keeps things modular and lets the game continue even amidst variable player attendance.</p>

<h2>Summary and technical details</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Characters start at level 8.</li>
  <li>Material from <i>Player's Handbook</i> and <i>Tasha's Cauldron of Everything</i> is all game, <i>Xanthar's Guide to Everything</i> is probably fine, too, but let me know if you plan to use this so I can add it to our Roll20. Unearthed Arcana can be dicier -- most of it is probably okay, but check with the DM first.</li>
  <li>Members of the Order of the Timeless Peace are paid a salary for their bravery, one large enough that, in theory, the temptation to take a bribe is... at the least, reduced. Furthermore, members also have access to the Order's vault of artifacts and magical weaponry. Though the ability to borrow freely from this vault is limited by the bounds of discretion, most agents are fortunate enough to have a favored magical item or two. Characters start play with:
  <ul>
    <li>500 + (1d10 x 25) gp</li>
    <li>Two uncommon magic items or one rare magic item</li>
    <li>Normal starting equipment for character's backgorund and class.</li>
    <li>A portal key that allows instantaneous travel to the Outlands from Sigil. These keys are <i>extremely</i> precious items, as most residents of Sigil cannot freely come and go. All agents' keys are protected by a 7th-level Glpyh of Warding that teleports the key back to headquarters if it is stolen without the agent noticing. Losing one's portal key to theft or other such legerdemain is considered embarassing and carries with it a censure when one finally finds their way back to Sigil (obviously, by some other means than the key), but is ultimately forgiven without serious penalty. On the other hand, intentionally selling or giving the key to another individual is punishable by death. A key of this sort sells for well over 30,000 gp on the black market, but few agents have ever dared to try, and none have survived.</li>
  </ul>
  <li>Agents of the order receive a salary of 30 gp per month, enough to live a modest lifestyle in Sigil.</li>
  <li>We are using feats and variant races where applicable, no need to obtain permission for these.</li>
  <li>All alignments are welcome in the Order. A chaotic evil agent is more likely to have ulterior motives, while a lawful good agent is more likely to have moral reservations about burning down a village that has become compromised by a mind-flayer from the Great Beyond. Everyone has a role to play.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Other character creation details</h2>

<p>In addition to obvious details (like your character's general backstory), I would also encourage everyone to think about answers to the following questions:</p>

<ul>
  <li>The Order has strict membership requirements, and most characters did not join the Order until they were at least level 5. What was your character doing before they joined the Order?</li>
  <li>What brought your character to Sigil and/or why did they join the Order?</li>
  <li>What does your character do in their down time?</li>
  <li>What parts of Sigil does your character frequent? (Not expecting everyone to be experts in Sigil -- I'm looking for answers like "taverns" or "libraries". Answers don't need to be specific places in the setting, although they can be.)</li>
  <li>What is one thing your character likes?</li>
  <li>What is one thing your character dislikes?</li>
  <li>Who or what does your character care about most?</li>
</ul>

<p>At session zero, I'm hoping to do a round-robin style discussion and try to have everyone answer these questions for their character. I realize that not everyone is going to have a deep understanding of the Sigil setting, and that's totally fine. Most members of the Order aren't actually <i>from</i> Sigil, and the player characters may have joined only recently despite their high level. It's fine to consider the answers to these questions in the context of a general fantasy setting (e.g. Faerun, the "default" world for 5e).</p>
