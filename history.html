<h1>History of Aria</h1>

<p>Anauroch has a long and troubled history. I have attempted to keep things brief and to-the-point here so as to convey the important points quickly. That said, I would encourage you to read more on your own and work as much of Anauroch's backstory into your own as you'd like. The <a href="https://forgottenrealms.fandom.com/">Forgotten Realms Wiki</a> has a lot of information. Not all of this is entirely canon in my own rendition of this world, but most of it is (unless I've stated otherwise). If you'd like to use something from this wiki, just check with me first -- it's probably okay, though.</p>

<h2>Pre-History, pt. 1 -- The Fall of High Netheril</h2>

<p>The Netherese Empire ruled Northern Faerun for thousands of years and was one of the Faerun's most triumphant empires. The Netherese nobility inhabited floating cities powered by enormous sorcerous engines, while the rest of their citizens lived in cities and towns dotting the then-green landscape of Anauroch. In -339 DR, the mage Karsus attempted to become the God of Magic, a disaster that sent the infamous floating cities of High Netheril crashing into the Anauroch desert, littering the wasteland permanently with sorcerous wonders thousands of years ahead of their time. What remained of Netheril was transported to the Shadowplane and was not heard from for over a millenium. The <em>first</em> fall of the Netherese Empire was the event that generated most of the ruins scattered throughout Anauroch; these ruins are thousands of years old and truly ancient. The reign of the original Netherese empire was a time of prosperity for Anauroch; the northern enclave was a land of verdant steps and running water. It is not known whether it was magic that forced Anauroch into this fertile state or magic that later ruined it.</p>

<h2>Pre-History, pt. 2 -- The Fall of Low Netheril</h2>

<p>Roughly a century before Karsus' Folly in -339 DR (detailed above), the phaerimm, monstrous, subterranean creatures native to Anauroch, began to attack Netheril, resentful of the intrusion into their native lands. While not entirely sentient, the phaerimm were sufficiently intelligent to be capable of coordinated attacks and strategy, and they had in their favor a strong connection to the Weave and were powerful magic casters. Their brutal arcane attacks against their invaders turned Anauroch into the aberrant desert wasteland it is today and left most of Low Netheril's population dead. To this day, historians debate whether the phaerimm's magic drained the life out of Anauroch's lands or merely destroyed the Netherse wards keeping the desert at bay. This debate is more than academic; the Bedine government in Aria is hoping that Netherese artifacts hold the key to returning Anauroch to its former glory.</p>

<h2>Not-so-recent History</h2>

<p>Our story begins in earnest in 1372 DR, with the return of the Netherese capital, Thultanthar, to the Material Plane. Thultanthar floated above the Anauroch desert, its return heralding a century-long (brief, by comparison) return of the Netherse empire. The Netherese set out re-establishing a hold on Northern Faerun, including enslaving the Bedine people inhabiting the desert they'd ruled thousands of years prior. As part of this expansion, Netheril attempted, unsuccessfully, to invade the nearby nation of Cormyr. Part of the reason for this invasion's failure was the simultaneous rebellion by the Bedine in 1485 DR. Dealing with the simultaneous rebellion and war with Cormyr, the Netherese had to briefly retreat. However, in 1487 DR, Thultanthar emerged over the city of Myth Drannor, heralding another attempted conquest. This conquest turned out to be ill-fated: The archmage Elminster Aumar killed Netheril's dark ruler and in the ensuing chaos, Thultanthar plunged into Myth Drannor in a macabre callback to Netheril's earlier fall. Both cities were destroyed in the wake.</p>
