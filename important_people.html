<h1>Major Characters</h1>

<p>Aria is a land of fortune-seekers and outsized egos. Compared to an average town, there are a larger number of parties with an interest in controlling local affairs, and clashes of personality (and indeed, steel) are inevitable. Below, I detail some of the important NPCs most people in Aria would likely be aware of, but please keep in mind that this is hardly an exhaustive list.</p>

<h2>Desai Dajala</h2>

<h3>Race: Human (Bedine)</h3>

<h3>Class: Bard</h3>

<h3>Affiliation: Bedine</h3>

<p>The governor of Anauroch is a complicated woman. Before her tribe moved to Aria in its early days, she lived the life of a traditional Bedine woman, confined mostly to her tent and family gatherings. Moving to Aria exposed Dajala to the life she'd always craved: One where she was free to pursue her own ambitions unchecked by tradition or societal norms. The more modern community nucleating in Aria served as a fertile template for Dajala's political talents, and she quickly grew from a tea-house debater to a true force in local politics. At the same time that her reputation for skillful debate and diplomacy had traveled beyond her inner social circle, Aria was growing large enough that House Immeril felt incapable of managing the situation remotely; a local government would need to be formed. In order to earn the support of the local tribes, Evereska decided to let the Bedine elect their own leader, and a group of elders from the tribes that had decided to settle in Aria decided to hold an election. Dajala won. Although the tribes that had settled in Aria were more forward-thinking than most, it was still surprising that a woman (especially a woman who was not elderly) would win such an election, and it is a subject of debate to this day just how much those results were influenced by Evereska. </p>

<p>Corroborating this theory, it is well-known that Dajala has good relations with House Immeril. Today, Dajala runs Aria with a shrewd but light touch. She genuinely trusts her Bedine advisors on their matters of expertise, and she knows the difference between advice and "advice" from her Evereskan colleagues. While Dajala's reign has been by-and-large successful, allowing Aria to grow into a successful archaeological outpost and fledgling trade center, her family life has suffered as a result. While it is known that she has children, she generally keeps her private life extremely private, and has never been seen with a husband, leading to speculation that he is either dead or long-separated from his wife. Recently, Dajala's concerns for the plight of her people have grown, and she has begun to entertain the possibility of an existence not dependent on Evereskan resources. She only shares these thoughts with her most trusted friends, and is well-aware that a Zhentarim dagger would find its way into her back in short order were her ambitions made public. She feels that Netherese artifacts hold the key to Arian independence and subtly keeps an eye on anything discovered in the mining operations. She employs a small number of trusted agents to vet these leads.</p>

<h2>Elihas Immeril</h2>

<h3>Race: Sun Elf</h3>

<h3>Class: Sorcerer</h3>

<h3>Affiliation: Evereksa</h3>

<p>The <em>de-facto</em> head of House Immeril and founder of Aria. Elihas's mother, Ielenia Immeril, is nearly 900 years old, pushing the limits of even elven longevity. In her senility, Elihas has stepped up to run family affairs. In his younger days, he spurned his familial duties and became an adventurer, spending his best years exploring the Anauroch desert. The wonders he saw during this time ultimately inspired him to found Aria. Although he possessed an affinity for magic shared by many high elves, Elihas was always headstrong and lacked the patience for the years of careful study demanded by wizardry. Instead, Elihas was intuitive caster, manipulating the Weave by virtue of his tremendous persona. His preference for sorcery over wizardry made him somewhat of an anomaly in local mystical circles, and he never fully integrated himself into this area of elven society. Although his spellcasting abilities have atrophied in recent years, he utilizes his familiarity with the arcane daily in his management of Arian affairs.</p>

<h2>Elohim Immeril</h2>

<h3>Race: Sun Elf</h3>

<h3>Class: Fighter (Eldritch Knight)</h3>

<h3>Affiliation: Evereska</h3>

<p>The younger brother of Elihas Immeril. Unlike his elder brother, he never grew out of his taste of adventuring, and after a successful career in the Swords of Evereska, Elohim joined the Cold Hand, an elite Evereskan military unit reporting directly to High Lord Duirsar. As a favor to Elihas, the High Lord gave Elohim a leave of absence to set up a post in Aria. Along with a small contingent of elven soldiers directly loyal to the House of Immeril, Elohim was sent to Aria to supervise the Zhentarim hired by House Immeril to keep order in the city. He is formally the highest ranking military officer residing in Aria.</p>

<h2>Hope</h2>

<h3>Race: Tiefling</h3>

<h3>Class: Rogue</h3>

<h3>Affiliation: Unknown (suspected Zhentarim)</h3>

<p>A young Tiefling woman known as the "Southside Succubus". Her origins are unknown, but she is obviously not Bedine; she has far fairer skin than any desert native and dresses in a comparatively provacative fashion, often exposing her shoulders and/or midriff. She is commonly found brokering information in the Southside's various taverns and has a reputation for gathering her leads through any number of less-savory means. Hope is widely believed to be a Zhentarim assassin. However, it is worth noting that several details of her existence are inconsistent with this rumor, such as the fact that she appeared in Aria several years before the Zhentarim were hired to keep order in town. She also doesn't appear to be a particularly capable fighter, though this could be an act. Her Tiefling "afflictions" are relatively minor; although she does possess the horns and tail common to her race, her skin is not an unnatural shade, and her horns and tail can be concealed with clever hair dressing and a long skirt, respectively. In a more crowded, diverse city, she could pass for human with some effort.</p>

<h2>Geth Brightwood</h2>

<h3>Race: Human (Illuskan)</h3>

<h3>Class: Fighter (Battle Master)</h3>

<h3>Affiliation: Zhentarim</h3>

<p>Geth Brightwood is a Zhentarim captain and the highest-ranking Zhentarim officer in Aria. He commands the garrison and is responsible for its day-to-day operations, although his authority is at the discretion of House Immeril (and most directly, Elohim Immeril).</p>
