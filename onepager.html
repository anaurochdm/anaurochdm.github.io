    <h1>Book 1: The Company Town</h1>
    <p>Welcome to Aria. A decade ago, the House of Immeril, one of Evereska's foremost trading families, decided that
        Evereska would no longer depend on its foreign neighbors for metal ore. Mining the nearby mountains was out of
        the question; it would compromise the sanctity of the Evereskan valleys. Instead, the elders of Immeril turned
        their attention to the Aunaroch desert, where the fallen cities of the Netherese empires, powered by
        unmfathomably large sorcerous machines, provided a near-infinite source of scrap metal ripe for mining. Thus was
        born Aria, an outpost situated south of the Scimitar Spires in The Sword, the hot, arid south end of Anauroch.
    </p>
    <h2>Setting Overview</h2>
    <p><em>The lessons of the past are too soon forgotten.</em></p>
    <p>Ten years ago, the land on which the Aria outpost sits was empty sand, far from the Black Road. Today, after
        subsuming several local Bedine communities, it sits somewhere between a village and a town, a roughly-5000
        person ramshackle collection of structures spanning a range between fortresses and lean-tos. The House of
        Immeril has reaped rich rewards from the metal shipped back to Evereska, and in return provides Aria with that
        which it cannot gather for itself: water, food, and similar resources.</p>
    <p>At the present, Aria exists at the mercy of its Evereskan patrons, but the local Bedine governor, Dajala, has
        other aspirations: Convinced that the desert's myriad of magical artifacts can transform Aria's arid
        surroundings into arable land, she seeks independence from Evereska and aspires to turn Aria into viable city in
        its own right. Governor Dajala's aspirations are not without merit -- during the days of the Netherese empire,
        Anauroch was a verdant land of plenty.</p>
    <p>Wary of Dajala's amibition, the House of Immeril has hired the feared Zhentarim mercenary company to keep the
        peace in Aria. Nominally for protection from marauding tribes and the fearsome creatures living in the Anauroch
        desert, the local government is keenly aware that Zhentarim work for their Evereskan masters and would turn
        their blades at the first hint of true rebellion.</p>
    <h2>Factions</h2>
    <p><em>Change has never come gently to Anauroch.</em></p>
    <p>This will be replaced by a more narrative write-up, but this should provide a sense of the power structures
        generally at play in Aria:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Bedine</strong>: One of two local nomadic cultures (the other being the D'Tarig) inhabiting the
            Anauroch desert. Although predominantly human, frequent contact with Evereskan scouts and merchants over the
            past two decades has seen a modest uptick in half-elf Bedine in and around Aria. They control the local
            government and run most of the business with Evereska. Most government officials, &quot;ordinary&quot;
            townspeople, and many local adventurers are Bedine.</li>
        <li><strong>D'Tarig</strong>: The other nomadic culture living in the Anauroch desert. The D'Tarig have a
            (somewhat, but not entirely deserved) reputation for trickery that contrasts with the stereotypically proud
            and honorable Bedine. While there are more Bedine than D'Tarig in Aria, D'Tarig merchants, drifters, and
            con-men frequently show up in town seeking fame, fortune, or naive foreign marks. The D'Tarig are a roughly
            even mix of humans and dwarves.</li>
        <li><strong>Everska</strong>: Although Evereskans are relatively less common than other peoples in Aria, the
            elven mountain stronghold has seen to it that its investment is well looked-after and maintains a formidable
            local presence. Evereskan elves are present in Aria in various capacities, including businesspeople, a few
            high-ranking military officials to make sure the Zhentarim stay in line, bureaucrats who &quot;advise&quot;
            the local government (they generally expect their advice to be followed), and various types of arcane
            experts (one never knows what one will find when excavating Netherese ruins). Evereskans are almost
            universally Elven and relatively wealthy compared to the average townperson in Aria. Although the House of
            Immeril founded Aria, Evereska broadly supports the project and elves from all Evereskan houses (which
            includes moon elves, sun elves, and green elves) can be found in small numbers throughout Aria.</li>
        <li><strong>Zhentarim</strong>: The shadowy mercenary company hired by the House of Immeril to keep order in
            Aria. They hire all races in relatively even proportion. It is worth noting that the Zhentarim do not
            uniformly agree on the best outcome for Aria's future, and some of their number could possibly be convinced
            by a sufficiently persuasive (or lucrative) argument to support a rebellion.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>While these factions represent the established &quot;party lines&quot; in Aria, there are <em>many</em> other
        sorts of people in town. Aria is the largest, best-stocked archaeological outpost in the Sword, and many of the
        adventurers who journey to Anauroch seeking its hidden treasures spend at least some of their journey in Aria.
        Furthermore, some traders on their way from southern Faerun to the Black Road stop in Aria to do business and
        resupply before closing distance to the infamous trade route. While the locals are predominantly human, dwarven,
        elven (and various combinations thereof), it is reasonable to expect virtually all races and walks of life to
        have some presence here, and the Arian locals are accustomed to this.</p>
