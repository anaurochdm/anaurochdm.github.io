<h1>Onrik learns Booming Blade</h1>

<p>It was excruciatingly early -- well before dawn. At the place where the dense foliage gave way to riverside ground cover, Onrik emerged from the fog and stood next to the druid Arne. Arne looked upon the river and did not turn to greet Onrik, although he greeted him.</p>

<p>“I’m guessing the darkness doesn’t bother you,” Arne said.</p>

<p>Onrik shook his head. Arne turned to the orc and addressed him directly.</p>

<p>“You should know that there are many paths to the power you seek, and also that most of these roads are closed to most people. I can only lead you to one of these paths, and even then, only you can walk it.”</p>

<p>“I understand,” replied Onrik, through a barely-audible grunt. After a moment, the half-orc fished awkwardly through a tunic pocket and produced a stone bearing inscribed runes and several artistic depictions of clouds. “I thought this might help.”</p>

<p>Arne eyed the stone. The druid quickly identified it as a spell stone tied to some thunder-based spell. Arne nodded.</p>

<p>“If you have any inclination for the arcane arts, this will reveal it,” the druid explained. “But,” he continued, “it alone cannot teach you to harness your abilities. Still, a good starting point, to be sure.”</p>

<p>Arne let the silence linger for a moment, then decided it was time for the training to begin in earnest.</p>

<p>“Put the stone atop your head,” he said. Onrik narrowed his eyes momentarily, but ultimately decided to oblige. As the half-orc warrior cautiously moved the stone towards his head, wary of its power, Arne decided to spare his dignity. </p>

<p>“I’m kidding,” Arne said. The druid’s expression remained perfectly deadpan, although Onrik was beginning to sense Arne’s taste for the occasional prank. Entirely incapable of handling humor, Onrik silently awaited real instructions.</p>

<p>Arne, for his part, obliged. </p>

<p>“Look at the stone -- study it. As you do, repeat after me -- dåligt väder. Over and over, quietly. It’s an old Nordic incantation for thunder. Dåligt väder.”</p>

<p>Onrik stared at the rock, now worried that Arne’s taste for prankery was all that he’d discover during this meeting. He repeated the incarnation over and over as he stared.</p>

<p>“Do you feel anything?” Arne asked.</p>

<p>Onrik shook his head. “Nothing,” he said.</p>

<p>“Keep going,” said Arne. “You’ll get the cipher right eventually.”</p>

<p>More than a minute of continuous chanting passed, and as Onrik began to give up hope of any activity, the runes on the stone sprang to life with a crackling purple energy. For a fleeting moment, that energy was echoed behind Onrik’s dark eyes, and then an impossibly loud crack echoed through the forest. The sound was louder than any man-made explosion. Loud enough, in fact, that the trees behind the pair had been shattered to splinters. Only Arne’s preparedness spared him from a similar fate.</p>

<p>“Thunderclap -- a classic trick of Nordic wizards. You have the gift. Druids are capable of the same, although this flavor of… destruction isn’t my strong suit,” said Arne. </p>

<p>Onrik reacted with only a stunned silence. After regaining his composure, he let his gaze wander to the spell stone in his hands. Only a smoldering pile of dust remained. Not one to waste time or words, Arne continued.</p>

<p>“Now try it without the stone,” Arne said.</p>

<p>Onrik turned to Arne. “How?” he asked.</p>

<p>Arne thought for a moment on how best to explain the arcane world to a new comer. Though he was used to guiding others through nature, this sort of mentorship was an entirely different beast. </p>

<p>“As I said, there are many paths to power. A wizard has their books, a cleric prays to their gods, and a sorcerer calls to their blood. A druid, of course, finds the same powers in nature itself.”</p>

<p>Onrik nodded, always interested in a deeper understanding of the arcane. “Do the gods not control nature?” Onrik asked. “Does Thor not decide which tree to strike with lightning and frighten away the trolls from the settlements of his faithful?”</p>

<p>Arne nodded. “An excellent question. This is the nature of the arcane and its mysteries. Ask the cleric, and they will tell you that Baldr answered their prayers for light in the darkness. Ask the druid the same, and they will tell you the Baldr commanded nature to produce the light -- and nature obeyed. The difference is subtle, but important. As druids, we believe we can similarly command nature. At a smaller scale, of course.”</p>

<p>Arne knelt and picked up a larger rock, which he quickly used to smash a smaller one into pieces. With a wave of his hand, he restored the smaller rock whole, the pieces moving seemingly on their own back into place and the resulting cracks vanishing, difficult even to remember once they were gone.</p>

<p>“The rock was the way nature intended it before I chose to interfere with nature’s course by shattering it. Nature is all too happy to restore the natural order. I only provided the nudge. This is the essence of a druid’s magic.”</p>

<p>Onrik paused, considering the implications of Arne’s explanation. “How, then, does thunder strike my foes when I will it?”</p>

<p>“Thunder strikes all the time. It is pent up energy, a release. Sometimes, all that is needed is a direction, a pointer -- and nature will let the energy escape. Try. The weather permits it -- the Nords are blessed with rain and clouds constantly during this time. All that you must do is listen carefully enough to nature that you feel you can speak to it. Then, tell it where the thunder must clap.”</p>

<p>Onrik closed his eyes and took a deep breath. At this point, Arne’s wisdom still seemed more like mystical woo than actionable advice, but his thirst for power beyond the physical world ran deep enough for the half-orc to cast aside his doubts, if only temporarily. And so, he set about trying to do what he once would have deemed impossible without the intervention of a god or Jotunn -- to tell the thunder when, and where to strike.</p>

<p>But nothing came. Hours passed, and Arne’s advice grew increasingly abstract as Onrik struggled to forge the connection that came so naturally to the druid. Finally, Arne accepted that a different approach was needed.</p>

<p>“You have the gift, but you are no druid. A druid’s power comes from a desire for balance, an anchoring to the natural order of things. Your power may live… elsewhere. I do not think I can teach you everything you wish to learn, but perhaps I can offer one more piece of advice. If not nature, what do you connect to? What drives your thirst for this power?”</p>

<p>It took Onrik but a moment to consider Arne’s question. In this one way, he remained more orc than man -- he closed his eyes and pulled his greataxe from its place across his back. Resting it in both hands, he gave a low, guttural growl, and suddenly, purple electricity crept from his hands and surrounded the savage orcish blade. A low rumble accompanied the crackling halo, and it traveled with the blade as Onrik moved it around slowly, entranced by the discovery.</p>

<p>Arne, unphased as always, said, “You have your answer.”</p>

<p>For the first time that Arne had ever seen, Onrik smiled.</p>
