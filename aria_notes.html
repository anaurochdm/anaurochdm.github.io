<h1>Building Aria</h1>

<p>These are my somewhat-freeform (but somewhat organized...) thoughts as I flesh out Aria.</p>

<h2>How many people live in Aria?</h2>

<p>According to the definitions put forth in the Dungeon Master's Guide, Aria is likely somewhere between a village and a town, with a population that is over 1000 but beneath 6000. At first blush, I imagine around 5000 people. Insofar as D&amp;D bears any connection to "contemporary" agrarian societies in medieval Europe, this would be quite a large settlement. However, Aria is a bit different. English hamlets were situated on relatively arable land and had the freedom to space out relatively evenly. In the desert, I imagine that there's a much stronger tendency toward huddling together for safety. This concept is born out, at least in numbers, by looking at our own history: <a href="https://voxeu.org/article/1000-years-urban-history-rise-and-fall-european-and-arab-cities">Arab cities tended to be much larger than their contemporary European counterparts prior to 1800</a>. I am doubtless sweeping a library's worth of important historical nuance under the rug by chalking this up to "safety in numbers" (indeed, the article I linked provides a much more in-depth analysis of the disparity), but I think this reasoning passes the sniff test and it isn't <em>too</em> hard to imagine that a desert archaeological outpost would coalesce into one stronghold rather than being a series of spaced-out settlements.</p>

<h2>How big is Aria?</h2>

<p>According to this <a href="http://donjon.bin.sh/fantasy/demographics/">random stranger on the internet</a>, a 5000-person medieval town would be 82 acres, corresponding to a population density of 61 people per acre. For a square mile, which was roughly the size of medieval London, this yields a population of 39,000, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Historical_urban_community_sizes">roughly correct for London in the late middle ages</a>. My current map of Aria looks something like this:</p>

<p><img src="./images/small.svg" alt="Map of Aria" title="" /></p>

<p>The basic idea is that the walled portion was the original Evereskan outpost, and the local Bedine and D'Tarig communities have gradually tacked on more and more; for every 100 nomads passing through, maybe a few decide to stick around. The road through Aria continues North and dead-ends into the Black Road -- even though the route is longer, this is generally considered the safest way to ship metal back to Evereska. The scale bar on the map makes Aria roughly 900 meters by 300 meters, or 67 acres. 67 times 61 is 4087, so that's relatively consistent with the population density estimates detailed earlier.</p>

<h2>The Town Itself</h2>

<p>More details coming soon about what those things on the map actually <strong>are</strong> :)</p>

<h2>Outstanding Questions/FAQ</h2>

<ul>
<li>How is food and water distributed? (I'm still thinking this through)
<ul>
<li>Independent merchants?</li>
<li>Distribution centers?</li>
<li>Official markets?</li>
<li>Zhentarim?</li>
<li>Centralized vs. dispersed</li>
<li>Are all the locations for these resources inside the walled areas?</li>
</ul></li>
<li>How accessible is the inner portion?
<ul>
<li>The inner portion is broadly accessible and isn't really restricted in any way. It was initially constructed to serve as a defense against the myriad of Anauroch's outside threats, and was never fully intended to control the flow of people within the city. The towers are staffed by Zhentarim lookouts, and in principle, the gates into the walled portion could be sealed, creating a true barrier, but so far this hasn't happened. Aria grew organically around the walled portion and people mostly just work around it, at least for now.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>What is the situation with slavery?
<ul>
<li>Bedine culture is vehemently against slavery (they were former slaves themselves) and generally do not abide its practice. While Aria is far more diverse than a remote Bedine settlement, its leadership and significant portion of its population is nevertheless Bedine, and slavery is officially not tolerated.</li>
<li>The situation at the excavation sites (outside - sometimes far outside - the city) is somewhat different. While Evereskans nominally project an enlightened image and officially find slavery distasteful, they don't go far out of their way to halt its practice; House Immeril is hardly the only Evereskan trade family to benefit from slave labor and they tolerate so long as it remains mostly invisible to them.  Although Evereskan officials in Aria or back in Evereska generally don't seek out or endorse the use of slaves, nor do they question the boost in productivity when a Zhentarim foreman has a caravan of them delivered to a mining site.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>What is the relationship with the tribes still living in the surrounding areas? Are caravans raided? Do they have deals with the Zhentarim?</li>
<li>What is the makeup of the population? Proposed below:
<ul>
<li>50% Bedine</li>
<li>15% D'Tarig</li>
<li>10% Zhentarim</li>
<li>5% Evereskan</li>
<li>20% Other</li>
</ul></li>
<li>What <em>type</em> of people live in Aria?
<ul>
<li>60% permanent residents (spend most of their nights in town)</li>
<li>20% semi-permanent residents (live in Aria, but their work takes them outside the city for days at a time -- like modern-day truckers).</li>
<li>10% regular visitors (merchants from Evereska or traders from nearby tribes)</li>
<li>10% transient (long-term caravans and others passing through)</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li>What languages are spoken in Aria?
<ul>
<li>Given the number of the different populations working together, the working language in Aria is Common, and this is the language you are most likely to hear while wandering around town or doing any type of business. For the same reason, the Zhentarim conduct all their official business in Common. Almost everyone in Aria has established basic competency in Common. Only very old Bedine and D'Tarig elders lack this proficiency.</li>
<li>The Bedine speak a sub-dialect of Madani known as Uloushinn. Madani is a language commonly spoken throughout Faerun by nomadic desert dwellers (most of whom share the Zakharans as a common ancestor). Through generations of Netherese rulership, Uloushinn, essentially a hybrid of Madani and Netherese, emerged as the language of the Bedine. Uloushinn has enough in common with Madani that speakers of the two languages have no trouble understanding each other. Uloushinn is the second most common language in Aria, and everyone who lives in or around Aria has picked up several utility phrases in Uloushinn: "Hello", "Thank you", "Do you speak common", "Another ale please", "I swear he took out his dagger first", and so forth. Player characters get this "tourist Uloushinn" for free without paying for a language.</li>
<li>D'Tarig, a roughly even mix of Dwarvish and Netherese, is also commonly heard around town. Unlike Uloushinn and Madani, D'Tarig differs too much from Dwarvish to be mutually intelligible with it. Almost all D'Tarig speak Uloushinn and the two tribes usually communicate in Uloushinn.</li>
<li>Most dwarven D'Tarig also speak proper (if rough) Dwarvish, though they generally only use it with foreign dwarves who don't speak D'Tarig.</li>
<li>Elvish is used by Evereskans to communicate with one another. At first, Elvish was relatively uncommon in Aria and used by elves to communicate without being understood by the locals. As time has gone by, enough of the local population has picked up some Elvish that the Evereskans no longer assume they won't be understood when speaking their native tongue. In general, Evereskan elves (especially those who have been assigned to Aria) are educated and generally fluent in (at least) Elvish, Common, Uloushinn, and Netherese. It's not uncommon for locals to speak Elvish, although elves will generally prefer to use Common unless speaking with each other.</li>
<li>Netherese is officially a dead language. The Bedine have no great love for their former oppressors, and Netherese is banned from official use by D'Jala's government. Older Bedine and D'Tarig nomads who have settle in town generally speak the language to some extent, though they are often reluctant to use it. The proximity of Evereska to historical Netheril means that many of the region's elves (particularly older ones) speak Netherese. Younger Evereskans generally learn the language in school, given its influence over other dialects in the region, although they rarely, if ever speak it.</li>
<li>The archaeological interest of the region means that Aria has a fairly high density of people with an above-average knowledge of history and arcana. As a result, there's at least <em>someone</em> in town who speaks almost any language one can imagine. However, if it isn't one of the languages mentioned above, you'll have to go out of your way to find them.</li>
