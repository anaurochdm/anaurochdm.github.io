<h1><b>Faction: The Order of the Timeless Peace</b></h1>

<p>Centuries ago, a deranged wraith opened a portal from the Abyss directly into the Material Plane, loosing hundreds of thousands of hungry undead upon its unsuspecting residents. Amidst heavy casualties, a group of arcane scholars, warriors, and adventurers from across the Plane banded together and banished the Undead back to the Outlands and, eventually, to the Abyss from whence they came. The heroes decided to remain in the Outlands and take up residence in Sigil, where they would guard its many portals against inter-planar intrusions. Thus was born the Order of the Timeless Peace.</p>

<p>Initially established to protect the Material Plane from the Outer Planes, centuries of service have broadened the mission to one of general inter-planar security. Because the neutrality of the Outlands is vital to preserving balance in the multi-verse, war between the planes poses a threat not only to the locals, but to the ideological balance of all worlds (imagine the Material Plane, for example, if only chaotic evil deities existed). The Order finds itself ideally positioned to defend this balance, as most native Outlanders are too committed to neutrality to take the actions required for a greater peace. In the name of cosmic balance, the Order readily shoulders this burden and in return receives the goodwill -- and enmity -- of many in the Outlands.</p>
