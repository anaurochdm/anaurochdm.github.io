<p>In the Outlands, where the gods dwell just beyond the horizon and their avatars wander the lands harvesting the riches of belief itself, a band of adventurers, scholars, warriors, and ruffians enforces the sacred covenant that ensures the Outlands remain a neutral territory for the gods to settle their differences absent cosmic-scale destruction.</p>

<p>Ever wondered why the celestial beings and eldritch horrors of the Outer Planes don't simply open a portal to the Material Plane and use force to claim their victory over the hearts and minds of mortal-kind? It's rarely for lack of trying -- Though the gods themselves are bound by magics older and stranger than even they, their servants hover endlessly at the seams between worlds, hungry for opportunities to travel to the Material Plane and spread the influence of their patrons more directly.</p>

<p>The Fool's Postern chronicles the adventures of the Order of the Timeless Peace, an organization dedicated to preserving peace between the planes. Stationed in Sigil, the center of the multiverse, the agents of the Order do whatever they must to uphold the fragile balance of the Outlands and shield the Material Plane from the gods' more direct machinations.</p>
