# New Player Checklist

### Get on the Discord!

* [Discord invite](https://discord.gg/5e8pjhy)
* Read the [introductory write-up](onepager.html)

### Reading

I want to keep the "required" reading brief, but I think players will enjoy the setting more with a bit of context:

* Write-up of Evereksa (page 82, Sword Coast Adventurer's Guide)
* Brief history of Netheril (page 48, Sword Coast Adventurer's Guide, in the "Ruined Kingdoms of the North" side panel)
* Skim the Darkhold write-up (page 77, Sword Coast Adventurer's Guide) to get a sense of the Zhentarim. There's lots on the internet and elsewhere in SCAG if you want to get a better sense of their organization (they have a long history in canon D&D), but it isn't required.

### Character Building

* Dream up a concept! I've built the setting in my mind as permissively as I can -- if you feel that a concept that you're excited about doesn't fit, hit me up, and let's see if we can make it work.
  * There are no restrictions on races or classes in the books mentioned below. The only requirement is that your character have a reason to be in Aria; the town has only existed for 10 years, so no adventurers grew up there.
  * Everything in the 5e Player's Handbook and Sword Coast Adventurer's Guide is fair game. Xander's and Unearthed Arcana content is _mostly_ fine, but please check with Dan if you want to use something, as some of that stuff is bonkers. Note that the Sword Coast Adventurer's Guide provides extra backgrounds that might be of interest.
* Post your brief concepts/ideas in the _Character Creation_ channel on the Discord. While I would encourage everyone to play a character they're excited about, I think the campaign will go better with at least some sanity checks on the synergy. While I would personally have a blast DMing a group composed entirely of halfling warlocks, that might not be the game everyone wants to play.
* Flavor:
  * __Rumors__: I'm not going to ask everyone to write a detailed backstory, although I'd encourage you to do so and will incorporate any interesting character hooks you guys throw my way. In lieu of having everyone read everyone else's backgrounds, I'm going to try something new. Everyone should draft 4 rumors about their character; two true, two false. Don't publicly state which is which. Dan H. will distribute these among the players, and this will represent what you have heard about a given PC upon meeting them.
  * __Desires__: Tell me what your character would change about the status quo in Aria. This isn't intended to be a character-defining motivation, but rather a sense of your character's opinion on the local situation detailed here.
* Build your character using whatever sheet/generator you prefer, but please put the final product in a [Google sheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1etrBJ0qCDXACovYHUM4XvjE0erndThwRLcUQzX6ts8w/edit#gid=1750226729) specifically formatted to be compatible with our Discord D&D bot. Trust me, this will make life _much_ easier in the long run.

### Miscellaneous
* Stay tuned!
  * As you all work on your characters, I'll be putting together the maps, write-ups, and images to make this all a bit more complete.
* Tell me what you want, what you really, really want
  * I want this to be awesome for everyone -- I would love feedback about the type of game you guys want to play. As the DM, what I enjoy most is you guys enjoying the game. Also, I survived years of verbally abusive, highly-educated narcissists routinely dismantling my academic ideas and have very thick skin. If something is dumb, fatally flawed, or worst of all, not fun, tell me -- I won't be offended, and want to fix it!
